                    <h1>About Malena + Resume</h1>
                        <p>Since you're probably here to learn a bit about my experience in the UX world, let me share my resume with you. I've made it <a href="files/MalenaHansen_Resume.pdf">downloadable (61KB PDF)</a>, but if you don't need another PDF on your computer, I've sorted out the details to <a href="#skills">skills</a>, <a href="#work">work experience</a>, and <a href="#education">education</a>.</p>
                        <p>In case you'd like to email me to chat about a project you'd like help in designing or a website you'd like to make more user-friendly, I'm available for contract work as well. Please send an email to <b>hansenmk at gmail dot com</b> with your project timeline and some introductory details on the problem that you're trying to solve. - I return email within 48 hours and am happy to set up a phone call or skype session to discuss your project.</p>
                        <p>I have some other projects, in both the mobile app and web space, that I'd be happy to share with you if you have additiona questions about my process, or would like further examples of my work. Please send me an email and I'd be happy to send them to you.</p>
                        <p>Outside of my love of organization, I spin fiber into yarn with my Lendrum double treadle wheel, knit with whatever sticks are available, weave yarn into cloth with my Leclerc Nilus table loom, am a dedicated bus / bike commuter, enjoy the meditative practice of drawing zentangles, am learning Fusion360 for building things with my Glowforge, make himmeli-inspired cat toys for Lily <a name="skills"></a>my long haired Norwegian Forest/Maine Coon Cat of Tortico coloring (honestly though, I belong to her), and I am a firm believer in the Oxford comma. </p>
