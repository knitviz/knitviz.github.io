            <h2>mobile application design</h2>
            <p>MK Designs was tasked to help solve the problem of creating a lunch money application to help parents
                and guardians manage their child's lunch money account.</p>

            <h2>challenge</h2>
            <p>The Lunch Money Buddy App needed to support:
                <ul>
                    <li>Signing up for an account using a code provided by the child's school.</li>
                    <li>Viewing the account balance and funding the account, including adding one or more payment
                        methods and the ability to setup auto-replenishment.</li>
                    <li>Viewing each child's lunch menu and marking a lunch as a favorite.</li>
                    <li>Confirming the child's subsidy status.</li>
                    <li>Managing the child’s list of favorite lunches.</li>
                    <li>Closing the account when appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>As principal designer on the project, I needed to understand the expectations of the potential users,
                not only against the app specifications, but also unspoken user wants and needs.</p>
            <p>I started with 2 provided personas:
                <ul>
                    <li>“Sam & Jorge” - fairly tech savvy parents of Brenden and Hailee.<br>
                        <img src="./personas/Sam-Jorge.png" alt="Sam and Jorge persona." class="md-img">
                    </li>
                    <li>“Henry” - non-tech savvy guardian of Joe.<br>
                        <img src="./personas/Henry.png" alt="Henry persona." class="md-img">
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>And to ensure I kept the needs of the users front and center, I followed my plan to:
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="h3">Story​ ​map​</span> to explore each persona's possible app-usage motivations
                        and several scenarios
                        they may face while using the app.</li>
                    <li><span class="h3">Mind​ ​map​</span> to explore the app's organization and start creation of a
                        sitemap​ to explore the
                        workflows and start thinking about the navigation.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="h3">Tree​ ​test​</span> using Treejack to test assumptions about the app's
                            sitemap & organization -
                            the feedback that I got from this initial user testing meant that I’d have to be specific
                            about in-app navigation to ensure that my wayfinding points were obvious, but that I was
                            clear to proceed with a hybrid organization scheme with both hub and spoke and nested doll
                            organization elements.</li>
                        <li><span class="h3">Update​ the sitemap</span> based on the tree testing results.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Start the app design process by <span class="h3">sketching​ ​wireframes​</span> to quickly
                        iterate on content location
                        and type.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="h3">Solicit</span> the first round of peer-review feedback.</li>
                        <li><span class="h3">Iterate</span> on the first round of lo-fi wireframes based on feedback &
                            continue to improve the
                            wireframes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><span class="h3">Start prototyping​</span> based on the lo-fi wireframes.
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="h3">Solicit</span> the second round of peer-review feedback.</li>
                            <li><span class="h3">Iterate</span> on the wireframes and newly created prototype based on
                                feedback.</li>
                            <li>The best feedback that I got really challenged me to think about adding meta-navigation
                                for the app - so I added a main hamburger menu that included some historical
                                information like lunch purchases and funding, FAQs, and a way to Sign Out of the app.
                                In addition, I added a lower tabbed nav / menu bar to allow users to easily determine
                                where they were in the application and then navigate to a new spot, if necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>results</h2>
            <p>I started by spending time with the personas (“Sam & Jorge” and “Henry”) and created storyboards to
                explore several of the each persona's possible app-usage motivations and then followed the action plan
                listed above. In the interest of space, the following steps focus on the onboarding - to show the child
                + user focus.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./personas/Sam-Jorge-Journeymap.png" alt="Inital sketches of Sam & Jorge's Lunch Money Buddy app sign-up."
                    class="lg-img">
                <figcaption>Sam and Jorge's onboarding journey map.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure style="margin-top: 20px">

                <figcaption>Henry's onboarding journey map.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Child-Focused</h3>
            <p>I went from this storyboard section where I started to explore what one set of the personas (Sam &
                Jorge) would want when adding a child, or children, to the application.</p>
            <p>I wanted the app to focus on the children and create an easy onboarding system. By asking for the
                child’s special access code that they would have been given by the school, I put the children first -
                instead of first creating a parental account and then adding the children. I wanted the app to be easy
                to use from the beginning, and so even from the download screen, I knew I wanted to instruct parents /
                guardians that they would need the access code first, before they could create an account.</p>

            <h4>Sitemap</h4>
            <p>I knew it would be important to create an outline of how the information was going to be organized, so
                after storyboarding, I moved to creation of a sitemap.</p>
            <p>From the storyboarding process, I knew a little bit about how my personas might use the product and how
                they might expect the information to be organized in the app… but I wasn’t sure exactly what design
                models would make the most sense, so I performed a mind mapping exercise to explore different
                organization structures. I decided on the following sitemap that has a linear account setup, hub and
                spoke design pattern radiating from the dashboard, and then a nested doll pattern for the sub menu
                navigation.

            </p>

            <h4>v1 Wireframes</h4>
            <p>From the sitemap, it was time to get some wireframes created, and the following show the first iteration
                of the linear setup process. This was my first pass at creating a public-facing onboarding, and I
                wanted to keep the focus on the child that was being added to the tool, so I asked for that information
                first.</p>
            <img src="./wireframes/mobile-v1-wireframes.png" alt="1st version of onboarding wireframes." class="lg-img">

            <p>After this first draft of wireframes, it was time for some design-specific feedback, and my design team
                was helpful pointing out where I could update wording or improve the process (not only on the section
                below, but also on the other drafted wireframes.</p>

            <h4>v2 Wireframes</h4>
            <p>The second iteration of wireframes led to this annotated wireframe selection - knew it would be
                important to confirm that a user had entered the correct child, so I added some validation and some
                error messages around possible incorrect entries- this way the user wouldn’t get too far into the
                process and then be unable to continue if they had the wrong account number.</p>

            <p>Using Sketch,I started focusing on a feel for the application, using the friendly and informative
                mailchimp communication style and creating wireframes that displayed larger numbers so that if a user
                had visibility limitations, they’d be able to see the number that they were entering. I moved the
                completion bubbles to the top of the page where the user would be able to tell how far along they were
                in the process at the top of the screen so they weren’t wondering how much more they had to do in order
                to finish the signup process.</p>
            <img src="./wireframes/mobile-v2-wireframes.png" alt="2nd version of onboarding wireframes." class="lg-img">


            <h3>Prototyping Begins</h3>
            <p>It was important that I didn’t spend an exorbitant amount of time on lo-fi wireframes, I needed to start
                prototyping so that I could get some feedback from my design teams. I was able to take my design assets
                from Sketch and import them into Proto.io where I started working on a clickable flow between static
                screens.</p>

            <h4>Feedback + More Iterations</h4>
            <p>Once I had all my screens in place, it was time for more feedback and additional iteration. I was able
                to focus on improving the onboarding experience and creating a clickable prototype for v2, where I have
                the option to add 2 children during first time setup and another child using a secondary workflow from
                the Manage Account screens.</p>

            <p>The following shows the screens from the latest iteration in my Lunch Money Buddy mobile app. I’m still
                focused on creating a child-first design, but I believe I’ve also created a friendly and accessible
                mobile app that is easy to use and understand, regardless of a user’s mobile experience.</p>

            <h2>lessons learned</h2>
            <p>During the app design process, I learned several important lessons:
                <dl>
                    <dt>testing is invaluable</dt>
                    <dd>W​hen I first heard about the project, I started to write down all the ways I would solve it:
                        sketches, workflows, and a couple of wireframes. I knew from previous projects that testing
                        with actual users is priceless, and should be done at every step of the process… at least as
                        much as can be fit into the time and budget crunch of all software projects. One thing that I
                        didn’t think about prior to this project, was how the different types of testing could fit so
                        well into a project. This plays into the second important lesson I learned as part of the app
                        design process, but it’s important to put this here as well: there’s a type of user testing for
                        all stages in the app design process.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I thought my ideas were pretty solid for the sitemap, but how could I claim to put the
                                user’s needs first if I didn’t spend time with users asking if what I was proposing
                                made sense?
                                <p>So, I spent a little extra time in the first stages of the design to source some
                                    parents and guardians who have spent time managing lunches and lunch money and ask
                                    them about my ideas and if they made sense, or if some organizational changes
                                    needed to be made.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>I didn’t make any changes to my sitemap before starting with wireframe design, but
                                because of my tree testing, I knew that wayfinding would be important in the
                                application and that’s why I was so excited about the design reviews to get feedback on
                                my first iteration of my wireframed way finding. Which leads me to how important design
                                reviews are….</li>
                        </ul>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>design reviews are super-helpful</dt>
                    <dd>Regardless of how much you like your design and think it’s pretty much perfect, it can still be
                        improved. Design​ ​reviews​ ​are​ ​important!​ ​I knew that my design still needed work, and I
                        asked pointed questions about the design and requested specific feedback around my wayfinding
                        when it was time for peer-review.
                        <ul>
                            <li>In addition to design reviews being important, it’s also important to know that asking​
                                ​for​ ​help​ ​is​ ​OK​. I had a couple of ideas on navigation and wayfinding in the
                                mobile app, but I was stuck on the initial idea of breadcrumbs because I like the
                                organization and how they serve the need for wayfinding in desktop apps and websites.
                                <p>I knew that if I were to implement breadcrumbs, they’d work OK, but I felt that
                                    there was a better solution - and when I asked for help around this specific item,
                                    the team was there to help with ideas.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Thankfully, I was able to move away from the ill-serving breadcrumb idea and into
                                something more mobile specific. While I’ll remember the feeling of being stuck because
                                I’m over-weighing all my options, the lesson of it being OK to ask for help when I’m
                                stuck in analysis paralysis will keep me moving forward.</li>
                        </ul>

            <p>This was my first time digitally designing a mobile app, and while I didn’t follow any design patterns
                for Apple or Material Design, I discovered how many resources and sets of best practices there are
                available. And unlike my experience with learning about resources at the last minute, I know that these
                exist, so that when I’m tasked to create a platform specific app, I’ll know what and where my resources
                are.</p>

            <h3>Tool Review</h3>
            <p>I was also able to take advantage of several new-to-me tools during this app design process as well:
                <ul>
                    <li>This was my first time using Sketch​, the Mac-based UI / UX / digital design tool. I knew when
                        I started using it that it had the potential to be an amazing tool; however, I didn’t know when
                        I started out that the amazing-ness potential is due to the number of plugins and, integrations
                        with Sketch.
                        <p>
                            Not knowing about these plugins caused a bit of distress when I attempted to import my
                            wireframes into Proto.io the first time because nothing was lining up exactly the way I had
                            designed it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Proto.io​ is a web-based prototyping software that is pretty powerful in its own right - might
                        be OK for UI design on its own, but it’s super power seems to come out when it’s combined with
                        Sketch (or another digital design tool) for asset creation and then importation of those assets
                        into Proto.io for mid-to-hi-fi mockups.
                        <p>
                            This project didn’t require hi-fi mockups, but if it did, I’m sure the combo of Sketch and
                            Proto.io would yield amazing results.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
