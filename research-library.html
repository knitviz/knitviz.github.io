            <h2>website redesign with user research + testing</h2>
            <p>This assignment was based off of an email Kent State recieved from the librarians at the Upper Sandusky
                Community Library in Sandusky, Ohio. The librarians were concerned that,
                <blockquote>Our current website look is quite dated from a technological perspective, and while there
                    is an abundance of information, it can be daunting for our users to FIND that information (i.e. it
                    could be organized much better).</blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>In addition to the redesign making information easier to find, the librarians had requested that any
                future website updates be uncomplicated so that the existing library staff can maintain the website
                without any extra strain on the library’s limited budget or technical resources.</p>

            <h2>problem</h2>
            <p>The Upper Sandusky Community Library’s website - redesigned after this project's completion (<a href="http://www.upper-sandusky.lib.oh.us/"
                    target="_blank">http://www.upper-sandusky.lib.oh.us/</a>) needed to be updated, and where possible,
                the library content should be repurposed and reorganized for the benefit of its patrons. Future
                updating needs also needed to be taken into consideration so that the website could be maintained with
                limited technical resources.</p>

            <h3>Website Review</h3>
            <p>The original information architecture/organization of the Upper Sandusky Community Library showed:
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/uscl-home.jpg" alt="Annotated USCL Home Page" class="lg-img">
                    <figcaption>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a mix of topical and task-based organization schemes in the global navigation bar with</li>
                            <li>primary “Our Library” navigation on the left side of the page.</li>
                        </ol>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the global and primary navigation options, the website offered 2 additional navigation
                options:
                <ol start="3">
                    <li>the offsite “Resources” which include the library catalog, and</li>
                    <li>another offsite database plus links back to the “News & Info” page.</li>
                </ol>
                </figcaption>
                </figure>

            </p>

            <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
            <p>It was initially suggested that the lack of clearly defined style guide caused the organic growth of the
                website’s organization (or lack thereof) and potential confusion of its users. I noticed during a full
                content analysis that there were several pages with recursive and broken links:
                <ul>
                    <li>the “Common Readers Discussion” page linked to itself from “Programs & Events;” however, never
                        linked to the content page and</li>
                    <li>the “Programs & Events” page provided a link to the library catalog’s best seller list;
                        however, that link takes the user to a page that cannot be found.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>During the content analysis, I also noticed that several pages (mostly the pages for special
                groups/purposes, such as the “Heritage Room,” the “Ellison Room,” and the “Teen Advisory Board”) lacked
                a cohesive feel with the rest of the Upper Sandusky Community Library website. The lack of a style
                guide not only can cause organization and navigation confusion to its users, but also causes the
                website experience to feel disjointed as a user navigates among all the pages, such as navigation among
                the pages listed above.</p>

            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>I knew that I needed to understand <span class="h3">first</span>, who the library was supposed to be
                serving and then <span class="h3">second</span>, review the information architecture for myself -
                before I could propose any solution.</p>

            <h3>Techniques Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial Website Review to evaluate the current style and information architecture of the website.</li>
                <li>Ethnographic interviews to experience librarian's interactions with their patrons and understand
                    the types of patrons they serve.</li>
                <li>Persona development to understand library patrons and their motivations.</li>
                <li>Style guide evaluation and update.</li>
                <li>Information architecture review and revision.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>What I Did:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I arranged some time with my local librarians Gina and Steve to complete some research into
                    understanding how the Upper Sandusky Community Library may have been functioning and who its
                    primary patrons were.</li>
                <li>Once I'd finished my initial round of research, I worked on developing persona primary and
                    secondary personas for the primary library users.</li>
                <li>After I developed the personas, I evaluated what tasks they would be most likely to participate in,
                    and created a matrix to display that information for ease of comparing motivations between
                    personas.</li>
                <li>From persona development and task comparison, I moved to evaluate the current information
                    architecture and develop a strategy behind the website's organization to inform the navigation
                    structure and future content additions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>personas + task evaluation</h2>
            <p>Based on the information I collected from my interviews with Gina and Steve, I figured that I had 2
                primary personas and 1
                secondary persona who were regularly looking to accomplish 6 tasks between them.
                <h3>Primary Personas</h3>

                </figure>
                <figure style="margin-top: 3em">
                    <img src="./personas/persona-justin.png" alt="Middle-aged man" class="lg-img">
                </figure>

                <h3>Secondary Persona</h3>

                    <img src="./personas/persona-chris.png" alt="Teenage boy" class="lg-img">
                </figure>
            </p>

            <h3>Task Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Once I had an idea about who my library users were, I started to get a feel for what they would use the
                library website for:
                <table>
                    <caption>A summary of how a User Persona would use the library's website.</caption>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Task</th>
                            <th scope="col" colspan="3">Persona</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
