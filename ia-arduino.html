            <h2>evaluating arduino.cc information architecture</h2>
            <p>This assignment was to develop an evaluative blueprint of selected portions of the Arduino website and
                to use that blueprint to analyze and critique the information architecture with the intention of
                suggesting improvements for the information architecture and content organization.</p>

            <h2>problem</h2>
            <p>The arduino.cc website contains a vast quantity of information and support; however, since the website
                is lacking a site map, it can be challenging to navigate from a specific support page to purchase.</p>
            <p>My challenge was to review the existing content + architecture to determine if the current organization
                could be improved, and if it could - suggest improvements and explain how my suggestions would improve
                the site.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./arduino/arduino-home.png" alt="Arduino.cc Home Page" class="lg-img">
                <figcaption>Arduino.cc Home Page as of March 2017.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>I clicked through each page of the arduino.cc website to explore and document the current information
                architecture so that I could understand the website organization before proposing any changes.</p>

            <h3>Tools Used &amp; Why</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Paper &amp; Pencil</dt>
                <dd>Used to sketch page relationships and information architecture diagrams.</dd>

                <dt>Google Draw / draw.io</dt>
                <dd>Software used to electronically diagram relationships between pages and explore the website's
                    information architecture for the project's final report and presentation.

                    <p>Useful for sending legible diagrams to other people in case of review.</p>
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>As I was clicking through arduino.cc, I started taking notes... and then realized that the site was a
                spider-web of links and different information architecture patterns.</p>
            <p>The best thing for me to do would be to document the current structure and add suggestions to that
                document so any website updates could be organized, and possibly made over time as needed&nbsp;/ with
                other site updates as non-breaking changes.</p>
            
                <figure>
                    <img src="./arduino/arduino-notes.jpg" alt="Arduino.cc home page IA" class="lg-img">
                    <figcaption>Ardunino.cc Home Page Information Architecture.</figcaption>
                </figure>

            <h2>results</h2>
            <p>The "current" information architecture is up to date as of March 2017. Some things may have changed since then.</p>

            <h3>What Should Be Improved</h3>
            <p>The collection of arduino.cc sites contains a vast amount of information; however, with its
                mix-and-match approach toward information architecture and knowledge management, it can be challenging
                for a user to find information at first attempt.

                I've charted my suggested improvements to help users find information in a easier to navigate IA.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./arduino/arduino-home.png" alt="Arduino.cc Home Page" class="lg-img">
                    <figcaption>The home page displays content using a database (bottom-up) approach primarily from the blog and store arduino.cc sites.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure style="margin-top: 20px">
                    <img src="./arduino/arduino-shop.png" alt="Arduino.cc Shop Page" class="lg-img">
                    <figcaption>The Software page on the arduino.cc site displays information in a bottom-up format; however, a top-down organization + extra topical navigation options implemented in the Navigation Menu would allow for a better user experience and would help the user looking for a specific operating system’s downloads to filter the page for a reduction in time spent scanning the page and user cognitive load.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure style="margin-top: 20px">
                    <img src="./arduino/arduino-arch-04.jpg" alt="Arduino Products Page" class="lg-img">
                    <figcaption>The Products page has several areas for increased cross-site navigation, such as for the Education sub-navigation option.</figcaption>
                </figure>

            <h3>What Works "Well"</h3>
            <p>There is an enormous amount of information available on the site with appropriately matching metadata.</p>
            <p>Searching generally works well and resources are approachable with plentiful inspiration. Navigation menus are broad and deep enough without being overwhelming.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./arduino/arduino_store.png" alt="store-usa.arduino.cc Page" class="md-img">
                <figcaption><p>The main Store page also suffers from lack of supporting navigation, seemingly the only option to filter items in the store is to use the main navigation menu under Buy, as shown above; however, the Featured Collections below the “fold” seem promising as a topical navigation scheme.</p>
                    <p>Though store-usa.arduino.cc isn't perfect and suffers from lack of either task or topical navigation schemes as a whole. Implementation of topical navigation would greatly assist users who are attempting to purchase an item based on project.</p></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure style="margin-top: 20px">
                    <img src="./arduino/arduino-arch-02.jpg" alt="Arduino Store IA Diagram" class="lg-img">
                    <figcaption>The Arduino USA Store page generally works, though as noted, I have documented a few things that would improve the experience.</figcaption>
                </figure>

            <h2>lessons learned</h2>
            <p>If a website, especially a commercial website, doesn't have a content strategy or an information architecture strategy and is allowed to grow organically, it will be a challenge to update its organization - or even track its own internal links.</p>
