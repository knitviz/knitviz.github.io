                <h2>problem:</h2>
                <p class="intro">The Upper Sandusky Community Library’s website - redesigned after this project's completion (<a href="http://www.upper-sandusky.lib.oh.us/">http://www.upper-sandusky.lib.oh.us/</a>) needed to be updated, and where possible, the library content should be repurposed and reorganized for the benefit of its patrons. Future updating needs also needed to be taken into consideration so that the website could be maintained with limited technical resources.</p>

                <h3>Website Review:</h3>
                <p>The original information architecture/organization of the Upper Sandusky Community Library showed: 
                    <ol>
                        <li> a mix of topical and task-based organization schemes in the global navigation bar with</li>
                        <li> primary “Our Library” navigation on the left side of the page.</li>
                    </ol>
                In addition to the global and primary navigation options, the website offered 2 additional navigation options: 
                    <ol start="3">
                        <li> the offsite “Resources” which include the library catalog, and</li>
                        <li> another offsite database plus links back to the “News &amp; Info” page.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>Areas for Improvement:</h3>
                <p>It was initially suggested that the lack of clearly defined style guide caused the organic growth of the website’s organization (or lack thereof) and potential confusion of its users. I noticed during a full content analysis that there were several pages with recursive and broken links:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the “Common Readers Discussion” page linked to itself from “Programs &amp; Events;” however, never linked to the content page and</li>
                        <li>the “Programs &amp; Events” page provided a link to the library catalog’s best seller list; however, that link takes the user to a page that cannot be found.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>During the content analysis, I also noticed that several pages (mostly the pages for special groups/purposes, such as the “Heritage Room,” the “Ellison Room,” and the “Teen Advisory Board”) lacked a cohesive feel with the rest of the Upper Sandusky Community Library website. The lack of a style guide not only can cause organization and navigation confusion to its users, but also causes the website experience to feel disjointed as a user navigates among all the pages, such as navigation among the pages listed above.
