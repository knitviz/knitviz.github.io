                <h2>lessons learned:</h2>
                <p>During the app design process, I learned several important lessons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>It’s​ ​important​ ​to​ ​test​ ​your​ ​design​ ​hypotheses​ ​at​ ​each​ ​step​ ​in​ ​the​ ​process.​ W​hen I first heard about the project, I started to write down all the ways I would solve it: sketches, workflows, and a couple of wireframes. I knew from previous projects that testing with actual users is priceless, and should be done at every step of the process… at least as much as can be fit into the time and budget crunch of all software projects. One thing that I didn’t think about prior to this project, was how the different types of testing could fit so well into a project. This plays into the second important lesson I learned as part of the app design process, but it’s important to put this here as well: there’s a type of user testing for all stages in the app design process.</p>

                        <p>I thought my ideas were pretty solid for the sitemap, but how could I claim to put the user’s needs first if I didn’t spend time with users asking if what I was proposing made sense? So, I spent a little extra time in the first stages of the design to source some parents and guardians who have spent time managing lunches and lunch money and ask them about my ideas and if they made sense, or if some organizational changes needed to be made.</p>
                    
                        <p>I didn’t make any changes to my sitemap before starting with wireframe design, but because of my tree testing, I knew that wayfinding would be important in the application and that’s why I was so excited about the design reviews to get feedback on my first iteration of my wireframed way finding. Which leads me to how important design reviews are….</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <p>Regardless of how much you like your design and think it’s pretty much perfect, it can still be improved. Design​ ​reviews​ ​are​ ​important!​ ​I knew that my design still needed work, and I asked pointed questions about the design and requested specific feedback around my wayfinding when it was time for peer-review.</p>

                        <p>In addition to design reviews being important, it’s also important to know that asking​ ​for​ ​help​ ​is​ ​OK​. I had a couple of ideas on navigation and wayfinding in the mobile app, but I was stuck on the initial idea of breadcrumbs because I like the organization and how they serve the need for wayfinding in desktop apps and websites. I knew that if I were to implement breadcrumbs, they’d work OK, but I felt that there was a better solution - and when I asked for help around this specific item, the team was there to help with ideas.</p>

                        <p>Thankfully, I was able to move away from the ill-serving breadcrumb idea and into something more mobile specific. While I’ll remember the feeling of being stuck because I’m over-weighing all my options, the lesson of it being OK to ask for help when I’m stuck in analysis paralysis will keep me moving forward.</p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I was also able to take advantage of several new-to-me tools during this app design process as well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>This was my first time using Sketch​, the Mac-based UI / UX / digital design tool. I knew when I started using it that it had the potential to be an amazing tool; however, I didn’t know when I started out that the amazing-ness potential is due to the number of plugins and, integrations with Sketch. Not knowing about these plugins caused a bit of distress when I attempted to import my wireframes into Proto.io the first time because nothing was lining up exactly the way I had designed it.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Proto.io​ is a web-based prototyping software that is pretty powerful in its own right - might be OK for UI design on its own, but it’s super power seems to come out when it’s combined with Sketch (or another digital design tool) for asset creation and then importation of those assets into Proto.io for mid-to-hi-fi mockups. This project didn’t require hi-fi mockups, but if it did, I’m sure the combo of Sketch and Proto.io would yield amazing results.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This was my first time digitally designing a mobile app, and while I didn’t follow any design patterns for Apple or Material Design, I discovered how many resources and sets of best practices there are available. And unlike my experience with learning about resources at the last minute, I know that these exist, so that when I’m tasked to create a platform specific app, I’ll know what and where my resources are.</p>
