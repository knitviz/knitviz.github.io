                <p>
                I started by spending time with the personas (“Sam &amp; Jorge” and “Henry”) and created storyboards to explore several of the each persona's possible app-usage motivations and then followed the action plan listed above. In the interest of space, the following steps focus on the onboarding - to show the child + user focus. I went from this storyboard section where I started to explore what one set of the personas (Sam &amp; Jorge) would want when adding a child, or children, to the application. Even though Sam &amp; Jorge are the more technically advanced persona, I still wanted the app to focus on the children and create an easy onboarding system - so I started by asking for the child’s special access code that they would have been given by the school, putting the children first instead of asking the parents to create an account first and then adding their children. I wanted the app to be easy to use from the beginning, and so even from the download screen, I knew I wanted to instruct parents / guardians that they would need the access code first, before they could create an account.</p>
                
                <p>
                I knew it would be important to create an outline of how the information was going to be organized, so after storyboarding, I moved to creation of a sitemap. From the storyboarding process, I knew a little bit about how my personas might use the product and how they might expect the information to be organized in the app… but I wasn’t sure exactly what design models would make the most sense, so I performed a mind mapping exercise to explore different organization structures, and decided on the following sitemap that has a linear account setup, hub and spoke design pattern radiating from the dashboard, and then a nested doll pattern for the sub menu navigation. From the sitemap, it was time to get some wireframes created, and the following show the first iteration of the linear setup process. This was my first pass at creating a public-facing onboarding, and I wanted to keep the focus on the child that was being added to the tool, so I asked for that information first. After this first draft of wireframes, it was time for some design-specific feedback, and my design team was helpful pointing out where I could update wording or improve the process (not only on the section below, but also on the other drafted wireframes.</p>

                <p>
                The second iteration of wireframes led to this annotated wireframe selection - knew it would be important to confirm that a user had entered the correct child, so I added some validation and some error messages around possible incorrect entries- this way the user wouldn’t get too far into the process and then be unable to continue if they had the wrong account number. Using Sketch,I started focusing on a feel for the application, using the friendly and informative mailchimp communication style and creating wireframes that displayed larger numbers so that if a user had visibility limitations, they’d be able to see the number that they were entering. I moved the completion bubbles to the top of the page where the user would be able to tell how far along they were in the process at the top of the screen so they weren’t wondering how much more they had to do in order to finish the signup process.</p>

                <p>It was important that I didn’t spend an exorbitant amount of time on lo-fi wireframes, I needed to start prototyping so that I could get some feedback from my design teams. I was able to take my design assets from Sketch and import them into Proto.io where I started working on a clickable flow between static screens.</p>

                <p>Once I had all my screens in place, it was time for more feedback and additional iteration. I was able to focus on improving the onboarding experience and creating a clickable prototype for v2, where I have the option to add 2 children during first time setup and another child using a secondary workflow from the Manage Account screens. The following shows the screens from the latest iteration in my Lunch Money Buddy mobile app. I’m still focused on creating a child-first design, but I believe I’ve also created a friendly and accessible mobile app that is easy to use and understand, regardless of a user’s mobile experience.</p>
