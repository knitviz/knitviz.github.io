                    <p>As principal designer on the project, I needed to understand the expectations of the potential users, not only against the app specifications, but also unspoken user wants and needs.</p>

                    <p>I started with 2 provided personas:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>“Sam &amp; Jorge” - fairly tech savvy parents of Brenden and Hailee</li>
                        <li>“Henry” - non-tech savvy guardian of Joe</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>And to ensure I kept the needs of the users front and center, I followed my plan to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Story​ ​map​ to explore each persona's possible app-usage motivations and several scenarios they may face while using the app.</li>
                        <li>Mind​ ​map​ to explore the app's organization and start creation of a sitemap​ to explore the workflows and start thinking about the navigation.
                        <ol class="alpha">
                            <li>Tree​ ​test​ using Treejack to test assumptions about the app's sitemap &amp; organization - the feedback that I got from this initial user testing meant that I’d have to be specific about in-app navigation to ensure that my wayfinding points were obvious, but that I was clear to proceed with a hybrid organization scheme with both hub and spoke and nested doll organization elements.</li>
                            <li>Update​ the sitemap based on the tree testing results.</li>
                        </ol></li>
                        <li>Start the app design process by sketching​ ​wireframes​ to quickly iterate on content location and type.</li>
                        <ol class="alpha">
                            <li>Solicit the first round of peer-review feedback.</li>
                            <li>Iterate on the first round of lo-fi wireframes based on feedback &amp; continue to improve the wireframes. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>Start prototyping​ based on the lo-fi wireframes.</li>
                        <ol class="alpha">
                            <li>Solicit the second round of peer-review feedback.</li>
                            <li>Iterate on the wireframes and newly created prototype based on feedback.</li>
                            <li>The best feedback that I got really challenged me to think about adding meta-navigation for the app - so I added a main hamburger menu that included some historical information like lunch purchases and funding, FAQs, and a way to Sign Out of the app. In addition, I added a lower tabbed nav / menu bar to allow users to easily determine where they were in the application and then navigate to a new spot, if necessary.</li>
                        </ol>
