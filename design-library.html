            <h2>website redesign with user research + testing</h2>
            <p>This assignment was based off of an email Kent State recieved from the librarians at the Upper Sandusky
                Community Library in Sandusky, Ohio. The librarians were concerned that, "Our current website look is
                quite dated from a technological perspective, and while there is an abundance of information, it can be
                daunting for our users to FIND that information (i.e. it could be organized much better)."</p>

            <p>In addition to the redesign making information easier to find, the librarians had requested that any
                future website updates be uncomplicated so that the existing library staff can maintain the website
                without any extra strain on the library’s limited budget or technical resources.</p>

            <h2>background</h2>
            <p>The Upper Sandusky Community Library’s website - redesigned after this project's completion (<a href="http://www.upper-sandusky.lib.oh.us/"
                    target="_blank">http://www.upper-sandusky.lib.oh.us/</a>) needed to be updated, and where possible,
                the library content should be repurposed and reorganized for the benefit of its patrons. Future
                updating needs also needed to be taken into consideration so that the website could be maintained with
                limited technical resources.</p>

            <h3>Previous Work</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt><a href="research-library.html">Research</a></dt>
                <dd>I needed to understand library patrons and tasks that they needed to complete on a library website.</dd>

                <dt><a href="ia-library.html">Information Architecture&nbsp;+ Content Analysis</a></dt>
                <dd>Before proposing an updated design, I needed to evaluate the purpose of the library's website and
                    ensure I understood how it was going to be used.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>Using the results of the Treejack tests, I first sketched wireframes with paper + pencil to test some
                ideas and then created wireframes with Axure RP that implemented the new information architecture and
                content strategy.</p>

            <p>Since I had built-in additional testing time to the project timeline, I was able to use Chalkmark with
                potential library patrons to evaluate the proposed site's navigation and content findability.</p>


            <h2>results</h2>
            <p>After thinking through and evaluating the needs of the library patrons for some time, I developed a
                focused hybrid organization scheme of topical and task-based organization and navigation to help
                library patrons utilize the Upper Sandusky Community Library - and librarians maintain the website for
                years to come with limited development resources.</p>

            <h3>Chalkmark Results</h3>

            <figure style="margin-top: 20px">

                <figcaption>These results show that users expect the library's hours to be available in a wide variety
                    of locations.</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <h2>lessons learned</h2>
            <p>Usability testing is important. Even though I thought I had initially created a pretty solid information
                architecture, with the help of usability testing, I discovered where improvements still needed to be
                made.</p>

            <p>I also learned that it's possible to keep pushing for more usability tests, and while they're important,
                it's also important to actually get the product to market and evaluate the success of the new site with
                pre-defined key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and user feedback.</p>
