            <h2>website redesign with user research + testing</h2>
            <p>This assignment was based off of an email Kent State recieved from the librarians at the Upper Sandusky
                Community Library in Sandusky, Ohio. The librarians were concerned that, "Our current website look is
                quite dated from a technological perspective, and while there is an abundance of information, it can be
                daunting for our users to FIND that information (i.e. it could be organized much better)."</p>

            <p>In addition to the redesign making information easier to find, the librarians had requested that any
                future website updates be uncomplicated so that the existing library staff can maintain the website
                without any extra strain on the library’s limited budget or technical resources.</p>

            <h2>problem</h2>
            <p>After completing <a href="research-library.html">my research</a> into library patrons and website use, I
                knew that improving the information architecture strategy was necessary to improve the library website
                as a whole.</p>

            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>I spent time to document the current page relationships and created information architecture diagrams
                with Visio to ensure I understood the current site organization.</p>
                <figure>

                    </figure>
            <p>As part of the site review process, I used Excel to document and evaluate content and its organization.</p>
            <p>And finally, when I had some ideas about how to improve the information architecture, I used Treejack
                (an information architecture testing tool) to confirm information is where users expect to find it in a
                website's hierarchy.</p>
            <h3>Treejack Test</h3>
            <p>The proposed sitemap was loaded into Treejack and 9 tasks were created to exercise
                the new website organization.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./library/task-evaluation.png" alt="Treejack task results" class="md-img">
                <figcaption>Each of the 7 participants were presented the same tasks, in a randomized
                    fashion to minimize participants from learning the website organization in the same order.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Proposed Organization Scheme</h3>
            <p>After exploration of different navigation structures, I proposed that a hybrid topical and
                task-based organization scheme (with some audience-specific content) would work best for the Upper
                Sandusky
                Community Library’s redesigned website - and help the librarians maintain the website with ease.</p>

            <p>According to my research, most library patrons want to:
                <ul>
                    <li>find when the library is open,</li>
                    <li>place a hold for a book,</li>
                    <li>renew an already checked out resource that is approaching its due date,</li>
                    <li>download an e-book,</li>
                    <li>register for events, and</li>
                    <li>search the catalog.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>New Organization Strategy</h4>
            <p>Since the library patrons' needs are varied, a hybrid organization scheme remains the best option
                for
                the website.</p>

            <h5>The Challenge</h5>
            <p>The challenge with a hybrid organization scheme is to keep each topic or task large enough to
                contain
                more than one page, but small enough to not require the user to have to search through multiple
                pages
                to find what information they seek.</p>

            <h5>Addressing The Challenge</h5>
            <p>This challenge can be met with multiple entry points to the same page; however, the duplicated entry
                points must make sense, and should not be so superfluous as to be difficult to maintain all the
                references.</p>

            <p>When new content is needed, the librarians should first determine if existing content should be
                repurposed to include the new content and if a new page is needed, reference the above user tasks
                and
                the site map/blueprint to determine the best fit for the new content.</p>



            <h3>Testing A New Site Map</h3>
            <p>Once I had my proposed new information architecure and strategy defined, it was time to test each
                with potential users.</p>
            <p>To test the new content organization, I used my Content Spreadsheet to evaluate content as seen on
                other
                library websites against the New Organization Strategy; once it was unambiguous where a new page
                would
                be added, I considered the strategy and new content organization refinement complete.</p>
            <p>Using Treejack, I was able to poll a representative sample of library patrons to test my proposed
                organizational changes.</p>

                <figcaption>Proposed Site Maps:
                    <ul>

                        <li>V2 Changes per Testing</li>
                    </ul>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>results</h2>
            <p>Using my representative sample of library patrons and updated site map, I was able to start development of wireframes
                that would allow me to further test the new website layout and content organization.</p>
