        <h1>About MK Designs</h1>
        <p>Hello! It's nice to meet you, my name is Malena Hansen, and I'm excited to share my favorite projects (so far) with you.</p>

        <p>I'm current a Master's of Science in Information Architecture and Knowledge Management with a User Experience Design concentration (insert catch-up breath here) student at <a href="https://www.kent.edu/">Kent State University</a>, with an expected May 2018 graduation. It's been a 2-year adventure and I'm ready to take on organizing the world with my passion for information architecture and user research.</p>
        <p>Please use the menu above to navigate my favorite projects: 
            <ul>
                <li>Lunch Buddy Money mobile application - solving the problem of managing a child's lunch money account</li>
                <li>Blueprinting Information Architecture - analyzing content and information architecture of a commercial website, with the purpose of making suggestions on how it could be improved</li>
                <li>Library Redesign - reviewing the existing information architecture and content strategy to determine how best to bring a library's website into the current web development age</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
