            <h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
            <p class="intro">My name is Malena Hansen, and I'm a passionate user researcher who enjoys crafting a well defined information architecture and content strategy.</p>

            <p>I've spent the last 2 years learning UX best practices and refining my craft through the <a href="https://www.kent.edu/">Kent State University</a> Master's of Science in Information Architecture and Knowledge Management with a User Experience Design concentration.</p>

            <p>Before we dive into the projects I'm sharing with you, let's talk about my method. One of the things I appreciated about the Kent State program is the LUMEN Model: Learn, Understand, iMagine, Evaluate, and iNform.</p>
            <p>Because the LUMEN Model is so easy to explain (and works so well in the agile methodology), I've adopted it as the basis of my personal user experience design process.</p>
            <p>As a fierce user advocate, I love the <b>Learn</b> and <b>Understand</b> phases where I get to do research to learn about the users, the issues they may be facing, and the context of the project... and then use that research to determine the best way of moving forward with a project. 
                <br>Once the research is compiled, I start to get excited, because it's time to start thinking and <b>iMagining</b> solutions to the user's problems - and then my past life as a tester comes into play! <br>It's time to test <b>Evaluate</b>, and then let those details <b>iNform</b> additional decisions!</p>
            <p>(There's likely a bit of lather, rinse, repeat here - especially if you're working in an agile shop, that too is part of the fun: learning from your users.)</p>
