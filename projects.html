            <h1>My Favorite Projects</h1>
            <p class="intro">I'm excited to share my favorite projects with you.</p>

            <p>Before we dive into the projects, let's talk about my method. One of the things I appreciated about the Kent State program is the LUMEN Model: Learn, Understand, iMagine, Evaluate, and iNform.</p>
            <p>Because the LUMEN Model is so easy to explain, I've adopted it as the basis of my personal user experience design process. As a fierce user advocate, I love the Learn and Understand phases where I get to do research to learn about the users, the issues they may be facing, and the context of the project... and then use that research to determine the best way of moving forward with a project. Once the research is compiled, I start to get excited, because it's time to start thinking and imagining solutions to the user's problems - and then my past life as a tester comes into play - it's time to test and then report on those hypotheses! (There's likely a bit of lather, rinse, repeat here - especially if you're working in an agile shop, but that's part of the fun too: learning from your users.)</p>

            <p>With that in mind, let's go through some projects: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="projects/blueprintinginfoarch.html">Blueprinting Information Architecture</a> - analyzing content and information architecture of a commercial website, with the purpose of making suggestions on how it could be improved</li>
                    <li><a href="projects/libraryredesign.html">Library Redesign</a> - reviewing the existing information architecture and content strategy to determine how best to bring a library's website into the current web development age</li>
                    <li><a href="projects/lunchmoneybuddy.html">Lunch Buddy Money</a> mobile application - solving the problem of managing a child's lunch money account, includes link to proto.io prototype</li>
                </ul>
