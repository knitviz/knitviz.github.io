            <h2>problem</h2>
            <p>OnShift Engage has a weekly survey program that once a week (or once every other week) asks an employee
                how their work day was, with a chance to add more information about their day. To fully measure an
                employee's engagement with their employer (our customers), we needed to add some additional survey
                types and cadences.</p>


            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>I knew that we would need to have a cohesive feel for all of the new survey types, so I began to explore
                how I might best organize the new features within the current Engage Navigation.</p>

            <p>After using my initial sketches to set up an InVision Studio prototype and completing several usability
                studies with customers, I knew how things should be updated for a better and more intuitive
                survey-management experience.</p>

                <figcaption>Proposed Information Architecture Updates.</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <h2>results</h2>
            <p>After the card sorting and usabiity exercise showed that my initial organization thoughts could use some
                refinement, I knew that I had some changes to make so that our customers could easily find and use our
                new features.</p>


            <h2>lessons learned</h2>
            <p>For my first major product design project, I would say that the entire process was a lesson.</p>
            <p>Focusing specifically on the desing process, every time I had a conversation with a customer,
                <blockquote>I was reminded that I should never take what I thought I knew about my users as a group for
                    granted and that while I had persona groups in my head, my users are each individuals with their
                    own needs and motivations for using our product.</blockquote>
            </p>

            <h2>next steps</h2>
            <p>As these features are still in development, I'm unable to show them in their finished glory; however,
                once they're released, I'll be able to show them here.</p>
            <h3>Post Release</h3>
            <p>After the features are released, I'll be monitoring their usage with Google Analytics and HotJar. The
                purpose of using these tools is to evaluate not only the usage of the feature, but where it fits into a
                user's every day work flow as well.</p>
            <p>Once the features have been in production for a month or two, I 'll be able to determine their usage and
                re-evaluate how they fit into our customer's work flow. Hopefully, I'll also be able to have a
                follow-up phone call with our initial group of study participants and ask them about their usage and
                how the organization and new features fit into their daily or weekly activities with the product.</p>
