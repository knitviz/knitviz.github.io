            <h2>my process</h2>
            <p>I have learned and adapted my process from the Kent State LUMEN model: Learn <i class="fas fa-comments"></i>,
                Understand <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>, iMagine <i class="fas fa-drafting-compass"></i>, Evaluate
                <i class="fas fa-vial"></i>, and iNform <i class="fas fa-share-square"></i>.</p>

            <p>I have been able to use this method to improve the process of research and design at OnShift and have
                started writing about what I've learned on <a href="https://medium.com/@HANSENMK" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</p>

            <h3>Research / Pre-Design</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>1) Learn <i class="fas fa-comments"></i></dt>
                <dd>I dive into research to learn about my users, user issues, and context of the project. During this
                    step, I might suggest detailed research, interviews, and / or competitive analyses.</dd>

                <dt>2) Understand <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i></dt>
                <dd>After Learning about my users, the next step I take is to compile that research to understand how
                    to continue on the project. I might create tangible pieces of work - such as personas and / or
                    journey maps - that showcase and utilize the knowledge learned. I use the compiled research to
                    inform the design principles used throughout the process.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Design & Testing</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>3) iMagine <i class="fas fa-drafting-compass"></i></dt>
                <dd>After working through the Learning and Understanding phases, it's time to start designing solutions
                    for the task at hand. While I might have sketched some basic solution ideas during the
                    Understanding phase, this is the time to deep-dive into the potential solutions. These strategies
                    and designs will inform the engineering teams who will execute the designs.</dd>

                <dt>4) Evaluate <i class="fas fa-vial"></i></dt>
                <dd>One of my favorite parts of the design process is to talk with customers and Evaluate designs with
                    usability studies and other tools. As the design evolves, I believe it's important to keep testing
                    to ensure the design is operating smoothly... and as intended. Based on the results, adjustments
                    can then be made to improve the final outcome. (And re-iMagine as necessary.)</dd>

                <dt>5) iNform <i class="fas fa-share-square"></i></dt>
                <dd>I frequently say (un-ironically) that I love documentation, and while this step is listed last in
                    the process, it's never the actual last step in my process. I work hard to ensure my entire team
                    (from Product Owner to Tech Lead and Developers to QA) is informed about how a design I create will
                    meet a user's needs regardless of where we are in the project's life cycle. I try to keep up my
                    documentation throughout a project, and always take time to document a design's effectiveness and
                    share the results with the team.</dd>
