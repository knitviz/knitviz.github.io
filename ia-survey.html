            <h2>problem</h2>
            <p>So rarely does one have the opportunity when taking over an existing product to evaluate its information
                architecture. And since I was responsible for adding a whole new component to the feature set of the
                OnShift Engage product, I needed to make sure that I was adding the features in an easy to access
                location where they would be regularly used.</p>
            <p>One challenge that often presents itself is how a designer is supposed to manufacture the time to do
                user research and testing calls with customers... and convince management that the time spent on the
                research and testing is worth while.</p>
            <p>As I've been working at OnShift, the biggest challenge that I face with every project is how to create
                time for research - and in the case of the survey platform, since I built research and user testing
                into the scope of the project - with product approval - at the beginning of the project, the challenge
                was finding a group of customers who were willing to help with a usability study.</p>

            <h2>actions</h2>
            <p>Thanks to both my product and customer success teams, I was able to find a group of wiling customers and
                set up phone calls with them individually for a card sort + usability study - and to ask them if they'd
                be willing to serve as pilot customers as we developed and released this new feature.</p>
            <p>Each call started with a product feature-set overview from my Product Owner and from there I would take
                over for the open card sort exercise followed by the usability test of mid-level prototype.</p>

            <h3>card sort</h3>
            <p>Using RingCentral with a Treejack study open, I loaded the study with 30 cards (what I explained to the
                customers were "Engage Widgets - a small thing that the product does or may do in the future") and
                asked my participants how they thought about the Engage product with resepect to the widget list they
                had before them. To minimize complexity, I used RingCentral and asked my customers to take control of
                my screen so that I could see what they were doing and ask their reasons for groupings or titles as
                needed.</p>

            <figure>

                <figcaption>OptimalSort Results from January 2019.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>With only 1 technical difficulty with my first participant, the other 2 calls went without a hitch and I
                was able to get enough information to challenge some of the assumptions we as the delivery team had
                made during story mapping and my initial information architecture decisions.</p>


            <h3>usability test</h3>
            <p>The usability test I designed was minimally interactive with fully functional navigation so that I could
                evaluate the assumptions I had made based on information from my Product Manager and the initial
                generative user interviews.</p>
            <p>Continuing to have my participants control my screen, I brought up an InVision Studio prototype and
                introduced the purpose of the activity as understanding how they would use the product and explained
                that in conjunction with the information from the card sorting exercise, I'd better be able to
                understand how they current use the product and how we could best meet their needs with our future
                development as well.</p>

            <h2>results</h2>
            <p>I was so excited that I was able to get a card sorting exercise into my customer calls because it was
                something that I was originally told we shouldn't need to do because we already knew everything about
                our customers - and based on the results from the card sort as shown below - there was still plenty to
                learn.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/card-sort-ia-survey.png" alt="Card Sort Results" class="lg-img">
                <figcaption>OptimalSort Results from January 2019.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Based on my initial information - and the current application set-up - it made sense to have all
                settings on one page with results on their own unique pages. However, based on the information from the
                card sort and the usability study - it was obvious that the folks who would be using this feature set,
                didn't think that way and instead thought about the information all grouped together for each survey
                type.</p>

            <h2>lessons learned</h2>
            <p>I'm fortunate that I was able to work the card sort into the usability study: I was able to show the
                value of questioning our assumptions and validating our experiments before fully developing and
                releasing a product to the world.</p>
            <p>I was excited to be able to report to my EVP of Product that we learned something from the card sort +
                usability test and that asking for this type of help & customer feedback wasn't a waste of time because
                we now knew that what we were working on would be useful and used by our customers.</p>
            <p>The challenge will be to reinforce the idea of this useful UX tool without being overbearing - the key,
                I believe, will be to continue to work with my Product Manager and Product Owner as we scope out new
                projects and build in research, as I <a href="https://medium.com/onshift-design/convincing-your-organization-to-do-user-research-4a3a850cddc8"
