            <h2>design background</h2>
            <p>I am a user experience designer and I graduated May 2018 with my MS in UX Design from Kent State
                University. Kent helped me develop a framework to use my experiences as a QA Engineer and Customer
                Service Associate to design thoughtful software.</p>

            <p>I use my passion for user research and information architecure to build user-focused development teams
                and to help inform organizational best practices. You can usually find me with a book or whitepaper on
                information architecture or research methods to keep myself up to date on new methods and best
                practices.</p>

            <p>I developed a template to build user research into the beginning of the software development life cycle
                to continually bring focus on improving the user experience AND improving an organization's research
                competencies. (I wrote about the first part on <a href="https://medium.com/onshift-design/convincing-your-organization-to-do-user-research-4a3a850cddc8"
                    target="_blank">Medium</a>.) As a result of my team using the research template, we have been able
                to build products
                that meet our users' needs while exceeding their expectations.</p>

            <h3>your project?</h3>
            <p>I am currently working as a UX/UI Designer and am looking to move to a more research-based role. Send an
